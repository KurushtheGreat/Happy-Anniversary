<h2 id="1">Our First Year Together</h2>

<p>Two years ago, I never even thought about having a girlfriend, but suddenly the sweetest, kindest, most beautiful girl entered my life. (That's you!!) Although our first year was nowhere near as good as this one, I'm so grateful that I met my dear wife. We started to make our plans together, thanks to you, this was one of the most defining years of my life, where I met the msot special person ever, and decided who I wanted to be with eternally. We had our ups amd downs this year, but I'm delighted with my wonderful wife. </p>

<h2 id="2">Our Second Year Together</h2>

<p>This year was even better than the last! we had so many good times together, and fell more deeply in love than I could ever have imagined. It all led us to this wonderful day, and I adored every second of the journey. We fell so much deeper in love, I want to be yours forever! We had such wonderful anniversaries, gifts and dates this year. Your 3d model of me, tour cute little game, and your photo shoot with Yali, I loved them all. And you took care of me so well, comforted me whenever I needed it, and made me feel so so loved, thank you, my dear, I will always be grateful to you.   </p>
